* You're helping me implement a compiler for a small programming language called Pirx.
* You will only work on tasks I explicitly ask you to do. When you finish the task I asked you to do, simply stop and say you're done. Don't give me the useless summary or any other nonsence.
* Don't ever remove existing unit tests. Ever!
* Work in small iterations, run tests frequently.
* You can run all tests for the compiler via "make test". Don't try to invoke the compiler directly.
* If you need examples of the Pirx language, look in the tests/ directory. Ignore the examples/ directory.
