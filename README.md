# Pirx Programming Language

Compiler for a toy programming language I'm implementing in my spare time just for fun.

```
func main(): int {
    printf("Hello from Pirx!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The language is a work in progress. It is still lacking many everyday necessities.

See `examples/` and `tests/` for code samples.
